If the writer cannot be identified, this data element should be left blank. Writers are those who own the intellectual content of a document, not the copyist. If the document has more than one writer, a new Writer field should be created for each name. Include life dates (in form 1765-1837) when necessary to differentiate between members of the royal family with the same name and title.

For higher level records, metadata in the Description field can be itemised to reflect the content of the lower levels of the hierarchy.

Thought should be given to subject keywords (people, places, events and topics) when entering the Description metadata. Quotations from the document(s) are acceptable in moderation, particularly if it is the only way to summarise the content of a document. Long transcripts should not be included.

The records of few administrative bodies are included in the Georgian Papers, but for those that are a summary of the organisation (or department) should include its title, purpose and function, and dates of existence as appropriate. It should be noted that the collections within the Georgian Papers are predominately artificial in creation and are based on records to, from and about an individual, rather than being records created by an individual. Some collections are also gathered together by type, and this should be reflected in the Administrative History. This data element should not be used for information about custodial history.

If it is possible to ascertain that the collection entered the Royal Archives with the main deposit from Apsley House, this should be recorded.
